Run `eecli init` to create a `.eecli.php` config file in the current working directory.

Open `.eecli.php` and follow the instructions found in the file's comments to configure your EE setup.

If your system folder is the default `system` and is in the current working directory, you *may* not need a config file.

You will receive a warning message if your system folder cannot be found.
